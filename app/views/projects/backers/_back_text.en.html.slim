h2 I want to contribute, how do I do it?
h3 How do I support this project?
p First, chose the value and reward you want. Then we will redirect you to #{link_to "Paypal", "http://www.paypal.com/", :target => :_blank} so you can proceed with the payment.
h3 When is the payment made and confirmed?
p Shortly after Paypal confirms the transaction. After that, if the project doesn't reach #{@project.display_goal} until #{@project.display_expires_at}, you will receive your money back as credits on Researchable.
h3 Oh, so I receive my money back if the project doesn't succeed?
p Yes! You receive 100% back as credits to support other projects on Researchable.
h3 What if I don't want to use the credits on Researchable?
p No problem. Just go to #{link_to t('credits.title'), credits_path, :target => :_blank}, up until 180 days after your payment, and request a refund. We will try to respond within 24 hours.
h3 If the project is successful, how do I receive my reward?
p When your reward is ready, #{link_to @project.user.display_name, user_path(@project.user)} will get in touch with you to arrange the delivery.
